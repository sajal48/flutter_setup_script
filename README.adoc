= Flutter Setup Scripts

This repository contains setup scripts for configuring a Flutter development environment on both **Windows** and **Ubuntu** systems.

== Prerequisites

=== Windows
- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Administrator privileges (recommended for Hyper-V support)

=== Ubuntu
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- Bash shell
- sudo privileges

== Usage

=== Windows

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Navigate to the `windows` directory:

   ```powershell
   cd path\to\flutter_setup_script\windows
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\flutter_setup.ps1
   ```

4. Optionally, specify custom parameters:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\flutter_setup.ps1 -FlutterVersion "3.24.3" -ToolsDir "C:\dev\tools" -JavaVersion "17"
   ```

=== Ubuntu

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `ubuntu` directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/flutter_setup_script/ubuntu
   ```

3. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x flutter_setup.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./flutter_setup.sh
   ```

== Features

- Installs Java 17 (via SDKMAN! on Ubuntu, Chocolatey on Windows)
- Installs Android SDK and Command Line Tools
- Installs Flutter SDK
- Configures environment variables
- Creates an Android Virtual Device (AVD)
- Runs `flutter doctor` to verify the setup

== Notes

- On Windows, ensure you run PowerShell as Administrator for optimal setup.
- On Ubuntu, you may need to log out and log back in to apply group changes (e.g., adding the user to the `kvm` group).

== Troubleshooting

- If the script fails, check the error message and ensure all prerequisites are met.
- For Windows, ensure Chocolatey is installed and accessible.
- For Ubuntu, ensure `curl`, `wget`, and `unzip` are installed.
